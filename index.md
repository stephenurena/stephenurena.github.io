Circa ~1999, when I was 11.5 years young, my family bought a 56k modem. The slow (but at the time fast) AOL dial up screens, the ever so often connection fails, found myself "hacking" my way into this tech field. I never knew I would find myself back into this field, but in the end I always find a way to automate my life using some type of script through IFTTT. It was the year of the upcoming Y2K bug, that everyone was worried about. From what I remember, something about computers not being able to tell time or what not. Well fast-forward to present time, the bug didn't bug, and we're still here in an advance world of ever growing technology. I love learning new technologies, currently taking a whack at C# through PluralSight, and hope to continue to build.
